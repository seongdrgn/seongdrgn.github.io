ABSTRACT = {In robotics, tactile perception is important for fine control using robot grippers and hands. To effectively incorporate tactile perception in robots, it is essential to understand how humans use mechanoreceptors and proprioceptors to perceive texture. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the impact of tactile sensor arrays, shear force, and the positional information of the robotâ€™s end effector on its ability to recognize texture. A deep learning network was employed to classify tactile data from 24 different textures that were explored by a robot. The input values of the deep learning network were modified based on variations in the number of channels of the tactile signal, the arrangement of the tactile sensor, the presence or absence of shear force, and the positional information of the robot. By comparing the accuracy of texture recognition, our analysis revealed that tactile sensor arrays more accurately recognized the texture compared to a single tactile sensor. The utilization of shear force and positional information of the robot resulted in an improved accuracy of texture recognition when using a single tactile sensor. Furthermore, an equal number of sensors placed in a vertical arrangement led to a more accurate distinction of textures during exploration when compared to sensors placed in a horizontal arrangement. The results of this study indicate that the implementation of a tactile sensor array should be prioritized over a single sensor for enhanced accuracy in tactile sensing, and the use of integrated data should be considered for single tactile sensing.},
